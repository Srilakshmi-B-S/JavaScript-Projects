This is one of the good project to do using HTML, CSS and JS. This project is really cool as there is a canvas present for Audio Visualization which gives the user a very good music experience.
There is even download option available which allows the user to download any particular songs which are available.

#Contribution to the Music-Player

1.The song will not start playing when we click on the Start button it plays only when we click on the play button present next to perticular song.
2.The canvas will be visible and starts working only after clicking on the Start button.
3.Can add some more songs, which can be categorized based on language and genre.
4.Search option can be provided based on which user can search any particular song name, artist name or album.
5.Providing a playlist creation option for the user so that the user can add songs of his/her personal choice and can create their own playlist.
6.Repeat and shuffle option can be added so that it makes the playlist better to listen sometimes.
7.Lyrics display option can be provided so that the user can sing the song along the track and can enjoy the vibe in a much better way.

There are many more features that can be added which makes the music player website more user friendly, but just by trying to add the above mentioned features it really provides better experience to the user.
These are few changes and add-ons that can be done 

THANK YOU!!!
